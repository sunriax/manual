## Description

The aim of our project is to help people building their applications and learn how they work. Also we try to abstract the hardware from the software to keep the software portable and abstracted from the hardware.

**We try to distribute our inspiration to other people and maybe we get some inspiration back...**

If there are any further questions feel free to start an issue or contact us, we try to react as quick as possible.

## Dedication

This scripts are dedicated to my father (Harald GÄCHTER), who taught me all this computer stuff. It is also dedicated to my girlfriend Pia, who taught me that even the biggest aim can only be achieved if it is done step by step. Also many thanks to my teachers (Dr. Neier, Mag. Vogel, DI Büsel and DI Dörler) @ HTL-Rankweil who supported me to improve my knowledge in electronics and information technology.
